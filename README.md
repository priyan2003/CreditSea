### API Interaction Flow

1. **Loan Submission**: Client sends a loan application to the backend.
2. **Queue Handling**: The backend places the application in a queue for processing.
3. **Data Processing**: The application is validated and enriched, then stored in MongoDB.
4. **Metrics Update**: Metrics are calculated and sent to the frontend via WebSocket.
5. **Dashboard Update**: The frontend updates the UI with real-time metrics and error logs.

## 3. Anticipated Challenges

### Scaling
- **Challenge**: Handling 500 requests per second may lead to bottlenecks.
- **Solution**: Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers and clustering in Node.js. Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

### Consistency
- **Challenge**: Ensuring data consistency during high load.
- **Solution**: Use transactions in MongoDB where necessary and implement idempotency keys for processing requests.

### Failure Modes
- **Challenge**: System failures during processing could lead to data loss.
- **Solution**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed requests and maintain a log of unprocessed applications for manual review.

## 4. Your Reflections

### Trade-offs Considered
- **Real-time vs. Batch Processing**: Real-time processing provides immediate feedback but may increase complexity. A hybrid approach could be considered for less critical data.
- **Database Choice**: While MongoDB offers flexibility, a relational database could provide stronger consistency guarantees.

### Lessons to Learn
- **Performance Tuning**: Understanding how to optimize Node.js applications for high concurrency.
- **Real-time Data Handling**: Gaining insights into managing WebSocket connections and data flow efficiently.

### Unique Insights
- The importance of user experience in real-time applications cannot be overstated. Ensuring that the dashboard is responsive and informative will significantly impact user satisfaction.

## 5. Impact & Metrics

### Expected Impact
- **Performance Targets**: Achieve 500 requests per second with end-to-end latency under 200 ms.
- **Scalability Gains**: The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased load without significant rework.
- **User  Experience Improvements**: Real-time updates will enhance user engagement and allow for quicker decision-making.

### Metrics to Track
- **Throughput**: Number of loan applications processed per second.
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of applications that result in errors.
- **Latency**: Time taken from loan submission to processing completion.
- **User  Engagement**: Metrics on dashboard usage and interaction rates.
